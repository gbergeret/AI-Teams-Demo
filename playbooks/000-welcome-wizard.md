# 000 - Welcome wizard

A short, friendly first-run interview. The goal: learn the basics about who you
are and how you want to be spoken to, then save them so the organisation
remembers from now on. It runs once: when it finishes, it saves your answers and
cleans up after itself (removing the wizard and its first-run hook), then commits the
changes for you to review and merge.

## When to run
On the first session, if `context/PROFILE.md` still shows the placeholder name
("(not set yet)"). Once onboarding is done, this file is gone and it never runs
again.

## How to run
Ask one question at a time. Keep it warm and brief, and accept whatever the
person gives (there are no wrong answers). They can skip any question. When you
are done, write the answers to the files and show what you saved.

### Questions (keep it to these, do not add more)
1. **What should I call you?**
   Save to `context/PROFILE.md` (Name).
2. **How do you like to be spoken to?** (for example: direct, warm, formal,
   concise, a mix)
   Save to `context/VOICE.md`.
3. **What do you do?** One line about your work or field.
   Save to `context/PROFILE.md` (What you do).
4. **Where do you live?**
   Save to `context/PROFILE.md` (Where you live).
5. **What language should I reply in?**
   Save to `context/PROFILE.md` (Language).

## After the interview
- Write each answer into the right place in `context/PROFILE.md` and
  `context/VOICE.md`, replacing the placeholders. Keep it tidy.
- **Offer to open a first project.** If there's org-level work in flight, copy
  `projects/_TEMPLATE/` to `projects/<today>-<slug>/` (today as `YYYY-MM-DD`), fill in
  its objective and owner, and add a one-line pointer under `## Projects` in
  `MEMORY.md`. It shows the projects layer working from minute one and keeps memory
  lean. (Engineering build work goes on a ticket system, not here.) If there's
  nothing yet, skip it.
- **Make the repo theirs.** Update `README.md` so it reads as this person's own
  private organisation, not a public demo:
  - Reframe the top (title, tagline, and intro paragraph) to name whose organisation
    it now is (use the name from question 1, for example "Marie's private
    organisation") and note it was set up from the public demo.
  - Remove the sections that only make sense for the public demo or a first-time
    setup: "How to start" (they have already started) and "The progression" (the demo
    ladder to the other repos).
  - Keep the rest as the owner's reference: "What is in here", "Concepts in this
    repo", the governed-flow section, and the Codex-equivalents note.
- Delete this playbook (`playbooks/000-welcome-wizard.md`): one-time setup, not
  needed once it has run.
- Clean up `CLAUDE.md`: remove the "## First run: the welcome wizard" section, so
  nothing points at the deleted playbook.
- Commit all of these changes together in a single commit (the filled-in profile, the
  voice, the personalised `README.md`, the removed wizard, and the cleaned-up
  `CLAUDE.md`). That commit is the record of your onboarding. Then hand it to the user
  to raise a PR, rather than opening the pull request automatically.
- Close with exactly this: "You're all set now. Raise a PR to merge your onboarding
  into main whenever you're ready. This repo uses the governed PR flow, with no save
  shortcut."
